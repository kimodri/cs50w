<!-- This is one of the trend becauase we are so used to renderng whole html from the server
however, that can be too inefficient if there are a lot of components that the html is rendering  
therefore, it is better to just use one page and hide the others using javascript

- This is also used if you are just retrieving contents from the database
- The strategy here is 
    - hide all the pages (except maybe the landing page) at the start with the styling
    - hide all the pages
    - show only the page that you want

<!-- The thing here is everything is on the client side, what if what we want is from the serverside ...
 That is the next lesson. -->
